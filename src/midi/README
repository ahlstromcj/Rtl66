Source Directory for other MIDI Support in the "rtl" library

This is the home for MIDI source code file adapted from the Seq66 project.
It includes mostly C++ files adapted from the Seq66 project.

All such files will be in the "midi" namespace.  This serves as an
indication that these classes are separate (though now used) from the
classes in the rtl directory.

Ultimately we expected these classes to serve as the intermediary between
the simplified Seq66 midibus classes and the Rtl66 classes refactored from
the RtMidi project.

The "rtl66" project adds more MIDI support (extracted from Seq66) to the
"RtMidi" library.
