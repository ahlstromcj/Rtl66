Audio Source Directory for the "rtl" library

2023-03-06 to 2023-03-06

The "rtl" project is a heavy refactoring of the "RtAudio" library by
Gary Scavone.  It keeps roughly the same functionality but is easier to
read and update.  The "C" API is preserved except for some minor cleanup.

All such files will be in the "rtl" namespace.

This directory is where the "rtaudio"-style library C/C++ files live.
