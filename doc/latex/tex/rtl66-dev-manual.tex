\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

   This document describes "Rtl66", a MIDI library based on the
   \textsl{RtMidi} (\cite{rtmidi})library, but with many changes and extensions.
   The following project supports \textsl{Rtl66} (and documentation):

   \begin{itemize}
      \item \url{https://github.com/ahlstromcj/rtl66.git}
      \item https://ahlstromcj.github.io/
   \end{itemize}

\subsection{Rtl66: What!?}
\label{subsec:what_is_rtl66}

   The \textsl{Rtl66} library is meant to support a potential
   \textsl{Seq66v2} application.
   It is based on the \textsl{RtMidi} (\cite{rtmidi})library, but with the
   following changes and additions:

   \begin{itemize}
      \item New naming conventions.  Not a big fan of camel cases, so
         class and function names have been converted to use lower case
         and underscores.
      \item Modularization.  Rather than a monolithic C++ file,
         \texttt{RtMidi.cpp/h} has been broken into a couple dozen separate
         files so that it is easier to zero in on a particular class or
         API.
      \item Additional support functions.  For example, a simple command-line
         parser has been added to support the test applications in a uniform
         way.
      \item Pipewire.  In progress, this API will be added and will be
         supported in \textsl{Linux}.
      \item Library code based on \textsl{Seq66}.
         This includes simplied versions of MIDI busses, calculations,
         port information, JACK transport, auto-connect,and more.
         This code can be adapted more easily
         for use by other developers.
   \end{itemize}

   The original (but refactored) \textsl{RtMidi} code resides in the
   \texttt{include/rtl} and \texttt{src/rtl} directories.
   The "C" interface has been preserved to a large extent, but the
   "C++" uses namespaces and modified names.

   The Seq66-based additions to the library are in the
   \texttt{include/midi} and \texttt{src/midi} directories.
   In the future, there will be a \textsl{Seq66} library that
   relies on the \textsl{Rtl66} library and adds concepts like
   performer, triggers, playlists, etc.

   There is also a \texttt{transport} directory, currently containing only
   a JACK transport class.  Perhaps we can add \textsl{Ableton Link}
   (\cite{link}) transport later.

   At some point we might add rudimentary audio support, for playing
   short clips.

\subsection{History}
\label{subsec:history}

   \index{history}
   Well into the development of \textsl{Sequencer64} (\cite{seq64}),
   we decided to add support for JACK MIDI.  After a quick look around,
   \textsl{RtMidi} seemed to be the best basis for JACK MIDI.  However, after
   getting well into development, it was found that the \textsl{RtMidi} model
   and the \textsl{Sequencer64} models did not align well.

   The result was a butchery of the \textsl{RtMidi} library, much added
   complexity to the application libraries, and a difficult-to-extend
   application.  Furthermore, the Mac/Windows support was dropped, and
   instead the existing \textsl{PortMidi} (\cite{portmidi}) support was
   used for those operating systems.

   With a big laundry list of potential upgrades, and a desire to
   simplify \textsl{Seq66}, it was decided to adapt \textsl{Seq66} code
   to \textsl{RtMidi}.
