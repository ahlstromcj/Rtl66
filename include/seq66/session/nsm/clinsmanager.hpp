 *  This module declares/defines the main module for the JACK/ALSA "qt5"
 *  implementation of this application.
 *
 * \library       clinsmanager application
 * \author        Chris Ahlstrom

 * \updates       2024-01-28
 * \license       GNU GPLv2 or above
 *
 *  Provides a base class that can be used to manage the command-line version
 *  of Seq66, as well as a helper for the Qt version.  Hence, it is in
 *  libseq66 rather than libsessions.  If NSM support is not part of the
 *  build, then nsmclient is type-defined to be void.  (We might refactor the
 *  concept out completely at some point.)
