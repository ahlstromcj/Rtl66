/**
 * \file          seq.hpp
 *
 *  This module declares a small manager for a set of sequences, to be used by
 *  the performer.
 *
 * \library       rtl66 library
 * \author        Chris Ahlstrom
 * \date          2019-02-12
 * \updates       2024-06-13
 * \license       GNU GPLv2 or above
 *
 *  This module also creates a small structure for managing sequence
 *  variables, to save on a bunch of arrays.  It adds the extra information
 *  about sequences that was formerly provided by separate arrays.
 *
 * Special static test functions:
 *
 *  -   maximum(). Returns the maximum supported usable sequence
 *      number (plus one), which is 1024, but could be increased to 2048.  To
 *      clarify, usable sequence numbers range from 0 to 1023 at present.
 *  -   limit().  Returns 2048 (0x0800), which indicates a legal value that
 *      represents "no background" sequence when present in a Sequencer66 MIDI
 *      file.
 *  -   legal(seqno). Returns true if the number is between 0 and 2048.
 *  -   valid(seqno). Returns true if the number is between 0 and 2047.
 *  -   none(seqno). Returns true if the sequence number is -1.
 *  -   disabled(seqno). Return true if the sequence number is limit().
 *  -   null(seqno).
 *  -   all(seqno). Returns true if the sequence number is -1.  To be used
 *      only in the context of functions and can work on one sequence or all
 *      of them.  The caller should pass sequence::unassigned() as the
 *      sequence number.
 *  -   unassigned().  Returns the value of -1 for sequence number.
